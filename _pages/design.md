# Game Design
>“If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they’ll screw it up. But if you give a mediocre idea to a great team, they’ll make it work.”
Ideas are dime a dozen.“ Ed Catmull, Pixar

I agree that ideas are dime a dozen. What's important is the work that one put in to realize them. As such, I share my ideas below for curious visitors to peruse.

Below are some design works in various stages of completion. 
Some are done for practice, others for fun. 
For more polished work, you should look at [Portfolio](portfolio.html)

## Game Concepts
I have a [list of game concepts](https://young-budget-8de.notion.site/ac598360526647d2895b4958161b0956?v=5cc3d92565a14b5586b9703214899322) that I may build one day. 

Some of them got to the Design Document Stage!
