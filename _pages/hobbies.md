There is a saying that a person should have three types of hobbies in life. 
1. One to make you money
2. One to keep you in shape 
3. One to stay creative


Let's talk about the latter two.

# One to keep you in shape
## Spinning
I have found that having a [Desk Bike](https://www.flexispot.com/all-in-one-desk-bikes-deskcise-pro) works really well for me. I've been working on my physical health and try to get at least an hour of cardio daily while playing some video games. Vampire-Survivor and similar games are good matches. Other games that are designed for controllers should also work well.

## Hiking
I enjoy hiking and would like to go on hiking more. It would also be interesting to make a game (perhaps a card game) that can be played while hiking.

## Class Pass
When I am with my girlfriend, we also take advantage of [Class Pass](https://classpass.com/) to try a variety of classes (hot yoga, dancing, boxing, soul cycling, etc). I'd recommend this for someone that's still looking for a hobby to keep you in shape.

# One to stay creative

## Tabletop Games
Of recent, I feel like I am looking at screen too much, so I wanted to find some hobbies other than video games. 
That hobby turns out to be Tabletop Games. Tabletop Games were always close to me with my interests in video game design and my time playing the Tabletop Roleplaying Game Shadowrun in college.

Whereas before I have primarily focused on cooperative games, now I'm broadening my relationship with Tabletop Games.
I've been working on my own tabletop game called [For Terra](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ztopxKPuGqGPfGdW7P6P5-BMriHVUvi6ybxSjElCtw/edit#heading=h.dpekn2uzbocj) and even drafting up a [Course Design Document: Tabletop Games](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yE3UHDJB2TIUaLWQSUkSK-cO_dg5cdq_6roOVqEz-4I/edit#heading=h.4eumze6z9666)

## Food
### Chinese Charcuterie Board
Have you ever wondered what a Chinese charcuterie board would look like? Well, I did, so I made one for a friend's birthday. It already featured an Ostrich Egg, so marinated eggs (ludan) were natural fit. It also involves a lot of soy products.
