The Game Genre & Innovation Slide aims to teach students about the fundamentals about game genres, deep diving into the genre of real-time strategy, and showing students how they can innovate by addition, subtraction, or emphasis aside from the typical innovate by inspiration. I created and gave this lecture to help students in CSCI 526 with coming up with innovations in their game, which is part of the course requirement.

This recording is meant for my own reference, so it only captures the screen at the side and with poor audio quality.
