> The use of augmented reality, virtual reality, and emerging immersive technology are growing rapidly in an increasing number of areas outside of the gaming industry. This technology has opened new approaches to training, journalism, tourism, and healthcare including mental health reaping tremendous benefits. Along with these benefits, though, comes the realization that much can be learned about individuals as well as their surroundings when using immersive technology.

> The purpose of this webinar is to showcase three academic scholars investigating different uses and privacy concerns related to immersive technology.
