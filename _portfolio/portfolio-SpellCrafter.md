The theme of Global Game Jam 2023 is **root**. We interpret this as finding the root of what makes spells different from each other.

A game based on spell customization. Players will be given a series of challenges and must figure out the appropriate spell to overcome the challenge. The challenge may be solved in various ways similar to Zachatronic style games. Players can optimize in different ways based on their own personal preferences.

Planning for the game started when the theme was revealed, but the majority of the code was done during the weekend. We took a prior work of a projectile taxonomy and see if we can turn it into a game.
