### About the Class - Advanced Game Project
CSCI 529a/b Advanced Game Projects, CSCI 491L/491bL Final Game Project, and CTIN 491L/493L Advanced Game Project) are a two-semester advanced game project class administered collaboratively by USC School of Cinematic Art and USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
It is a year-long group project class featuring interdisciplinary and self driven student teams with the results presented at USC Demo Day (Now USC Games Expo).

Instructors for the class were [Michael Zyda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikezyda/), [Scott Easley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-easley-b209771/), and [Laird Malamed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lairdo/).

[Outer Wilds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Wilds) was one of the game that came out of Advanced Game Projects, which I was able to document during their [initial pitch](https://youtu.be/GvC2OBM2AdI), [fall semester recruitment](https://youtu.be/-C0heGutkqg), and [midterm progress](https://youtu.be/Tgq-tpbEOnQ)

### My Role at Advanced Game Project
I was the Teaching Assistant, along with [Balki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balkithewise/) and [Josh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-joiner/),
