excerpt: "AGP is the capstone and perhaps the most important class at USC Games. While foolish and detrimental to graduating on time, I dedicated my first two years of PhD to doing what I can to improve AGP and games program at USC. I did a lot, messed up a lot, and learned a lot. I look forward to doing something like this again (but better)."

## Impact of AGP
Students come to AGP for a variety of different goals, such as a portfolio piece, art piece, to start a company, etc. For the visitor, what came out of AGP during my time as TA that you may know are the following.
[Outer Wilds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Wilds) was one of the game that came out of Advanced Game Projects, which I was able to document during their [initial pitch](https://youtu.be/GvC2OBM2AdI), [fall semester recruitment](https://youtu.be/-C0heGutkqg), and [midterm progress](https://youtu.be/Tgq-tpbEOnQ). Leads at Wild Skies/Project Holodeck went on to form [Survios](https://survios.com/studio/), a virtual reality game developer and publisher. [^2]

## My Role at Advanced Game Projects
I was the Teaching Assistant, along with [Balki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balkithewise/) and [Josh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-joiner/). Joined by [Brooke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brookehubert/) the second year. 
I was blessed with the opportunity to take on many responsibilities as well as new initiatives to improve the course. Some examples include: 
* Being and recruiting art school liaison to foster collaboration between USC and nearby art schools, such as [Laguna College of Art & Design](https://www.lcad.edu/), [Gnomon](https://www.gnomon.edu/), [ArtCenter College of Design](https://www.artcenter.edu/), [OTIS College of Art and Design](https://www.otis.edu/index.html), etc.
* GamePipe Lab manager that handles the equipment and recommending equipment and software purchases
* Event liaison between student teams and the tech team to coordinate and plan the event for the USC Demo Day, which happens at the end of Fall and Spring semester. [USC Demo Day 2013](https://cinema.usc.edu/news/article.cfm?id=13575)
* Event planning and execution, such as welcome party of new game students, game jam, AGP pitch and judging for next year's AGP, etc.
* Recording midterm and final presentations for future reference [^3]
* Software Installation and Hardware Maintenance
* rewriting syllabus, connecting mentors to teams, compiling list of references and resources, and more... [^4]

# About the Class - Free to Play Game Development
CSCI 499 Free to Play Game Development teaches students to develop games with free to play paradigm such as ones found on social networks.

Instructors for the class were [Chris Swain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisswain1/)(mainly), [Scott Easley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-easley-b209771/), and [Anshul Dhawan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshuldhawan/)(Alumni, covers the tech part, and as representative from Zynga)

## How I became the TA
I actually wasn't officially the TA for this class. Being the AGP TA and trying to help the USC games program in general, I make sure the lab and classroom space is running well. 
When I heard that we may be getting a new professor and there's a new class. I swung by the class to make sure the audio/visual is working and that the class can otherwise run smoothly. 
I stayed to listen to the lecture and see what the class was about. I enjoyed the lecture and very much respected professor Swain for all the work he puts in. I ended up returning to make sure AV is working and staying for the lecture. Rinse & repeated this a few times. It wasn't until one time I went to get a sandwich after making sure audiovisual worked and that class has started to later get a message from professor Swain asking me where I was as he thought I was the assigned TA[^5]. I figured I might as well continue what I do pro bono and enjoy the fact I am basically auditing the class. That's the story of how I inadvertently became a TA for another class.[^6]

## My Role at Free to Play Game Development
My role here is what you would typically expect from a TA - making sure the audio visual is working, answering students questions, and in general trying to make sure the class runs smoothly.

# Footnote
[^1]: I suspect I popularized the initialism of AGP as the definitive way of referring to these joint classes. Having sent out countless emails with the subject heading of "Advanced Game Projects and Final Game Projects", I just started using AGP. Then again, it's probably inevitable anyway if it wasn't already done before me.
[^2]: I make no claim to their success. Their many years of hardwork got them to where they are. I just hope they forgive me for the many many questionnaires I suggested that we add to the class to better understand how to improve the class.
[^3]: As it was more of a nice to have that I wanted to do for the course, it was not done very professionally. Some of the videos recorded were uploaded to my own [personal YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PowenYao/videos) and some to the [USC GamePipe Laboratory YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@USCGamePipeLaboratory/videos). On the bright side, the videos relating to Outer Wilds became the highest viewed video on my channel as it offered an insight to the fans of the game what it looked like in early development. I like to think it was worth the effort.
[^4]: I don't think Chris knows to this day - maybe I will carry it to my grave.
[^5]: I'm writing this a decade later and don't remember all the things I have done. If I thought it could help the course and the professors allowed me to try, I'd then go do it.
[^6]: I actually end up doing what TA do in a lot of the classes I take. It has somewhat become a force of habit to want to make sure the class run smoothly. At some point, I carry markers, presentation clicker, and AV cables. I'd offer to help in whichever class I'm in.
[^7]: The syllabus went from 10 page in the first year to 21 in the second year, which should have removed the need for another syllabus in the follow-up semester.
